# Session 8 Report - 07.02.2024 - Julius Ortstadt

## Before today's session
- I wrote a test programm for one of the motor encoders to fully understand how they work and how I will eventually use their data to make a PID corrector for the robot.

- I designed the fuse holder I ordered so that I can put it in the 3D model of the robot and later easier design the entire back panel.\

## During today's session
- I received the components I ordered. This enabled me to really progress in the assembling process.

- I prepared the base plate for installation of the frame and the stack. Meaning I had to mark the new holes, drill them and unscrew other components so that all can be assembled.

- I assembled the frame. In order to do that I had to make some small adjustments like deepening the holes for the screws and put in the inserts.\

- I printed and assembled the "stack" which is the Arduino stacked on top of the H-Bridge. This will allow us to save space and also fit the Nvidia Jetson in the back of the robot.\

- I started soldering the shield for the Arduino Mega. This will allow us to completely remove simple Arduino connectors and therefore only use soldered connections or those with screws.\

## For the next session
- I will redesign some parts of the stack for the Arduino and the H-Bridge since, during installation, there were some fiting problems.

- I will continue thinking about the placement of the components on the Arduino shield.

- I will start designing the component that will eventually hold the connectors. These connectors will be the interface between the movable base and the grabbing system.
