# Session 2 Report - 21.11.2023 - Julius Ortstadt

Before today's session I received the last components from the 1st order that I needed in order to start building the prototype. Those components being:
- 2 motors with gear reductor and encoder
- 1 control module to control the two motors
- 2 scooter wheels that will be motorized
- 2 wheel hubs in order to fix the wheels on the motor shaft
- 2 ball caster wheels that will assist with stability
- 2 support brackets to hold the motors in place

I also started creating 3D models of some of these components where I had a datasheet with the precise measurments.
I created models for:
- the scooter wheel. We chose this type of wheel since it offers a good amount of grip on the surface the robot will navigate on. Additionally it doesn't take up a lot of space which is benificial since we don't have a lot of it.\

- the wheel hub that will connect the wheel to the motor shaft. It will clam the wheel from both sides. Then two little screws allow the entire structure to be fixed the the shaft.\

During today's session, I continued the 3D models of different components so that an assembly of the entire robot could be made within Fusion 360.
I continued with the ball caster wheel:

Moreover, I also started assembling differents parts of the project within Fusion 360.
This is a prototype for the base, primarly focused on the line following and the usage of the motors by including the motor assembly, the caster wheels and the IR Sensor:

After recreating the wanted surface for the base, meaning implementing the fixation holes for all the different components in Inkscape. I started assembling the components so that I could make some motor tests and test the line following system:

- Assembly process\

This concludes today's session. Next will be testing the motors and the line following as well as implement an ultrasonic sensor to stop the robot if needed.
Note that this is a prototype and changes can be made. The goal of these steps are to test the different functionnalities before building the entire robot in phase 1. After we will do the same process again to achieve our goal for phase 2.
