# Session 10 Report - 21.02.2024 - Julius Ortstadt

## Before today's session
- We discussed how we will integrate both parts of the robot together. We came to the conclusion that we will use one big plug for the main data transfert and one smaller for power and ground.
A connector would look like something like this:\

## During today's session
- I repaired some soldered points on the shield. These needed more solder mass and some were not connected, therefore no signal would have been able to pass through.

- I finished soldering the connectors to the Mega shield and started connecting cables to it.\

- I built a new smaller PCB which will feature all GND and +5V cables from the sensors. Since there are quite a lot, this saves space on the Mega shield and allows for better cable managment in the end.\

- I installed the small PCB on the robot. For support I glued some spacers on the bottom side of the PCB and screwed it onto the base plate of the robot.\

- I prepared some cables that will be installed later. These will be used for +5V and GND.

- We discussed the possibility of using a QR code scanner on the robot and not necessarily use a camera for that task.

- I made some small corrections to the robot, so that assembly would be easier and re-routed some cables for better cable managment.

## For the next session
- I will continue the assembly of the shield, meaning connect all the cables and sensors. This will allow me to do the first tests of the completed base.

- Code some of the different programms I will need in order to check if everything is working correctly.
