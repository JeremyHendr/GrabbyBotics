# Session 7 Report - 23.01.2024 - Julius Ortstadt

## Before today's session
- I designed the stacking mechanism which will allow us to put the Arduino above the H-Brigde. This will save space and enable us to keep the main electronics in the back of the robot.\

- I prepared the files for the side panels so that I can make them during today's session.\

- I printed the final version of the IR sensor rail.


## During today's session
- I assembled the pieces I printed for the frame. This was only a test fit. I needed to make some small adjustments. The final pieces are in the process of being printed.\

- I assembled the IR sensor rail meaning I spaced out the sensors so that there is one tape width between them, I also needed to enlarge the hole through which the sensors will see the ground. I wired all the sensors up so that they can be used. The final wiring will be done later, for now it is just for testing purposes.\

- By using the laser cutting machine, I prepared the side panels. I installed the ultrasonic sensors and started wiring them up. However, the rest of the frame is needed to hold everything in place.\

- We discussed different strategies of how we will combine the two parts of the robot, meaning the mobile base and the grabbing system. Our main point of focus was how we would create the wired connection between these two parts. We will probably assemble a shield for the Arduino Mega onto which we'll solder connectors. These will enable us to create more stable connections between the wires and the main electronic components. The connection between the two will be achieved using connectors (male and female) like in computers, which have a stronger resistance when pulled upon compared to classic arduino cables.


## For the next session
- The frame will be printed and the assembly can start.

- I'll continue the code for the robot in order to get it operational.

- I'll design the back panel of the robot.
