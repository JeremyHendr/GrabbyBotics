# Velocity Compute
#### Author: Julius Ortstadt

Here you can find an Arduino code to control the robot with different PWM values and then retrieve all the necessary information via the bluetooth serial connection. 
However, manual measurements for verification are encouraged although not necessary.

Also, an excel sheet can be found where the measured values can be entered in order to get the coefficients for a least-squares curve fitting using the batch approach. 
This will yield a relation between the speed in m/s of the robot and the applied PWM signal.
