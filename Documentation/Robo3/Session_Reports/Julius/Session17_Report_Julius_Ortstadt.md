# Session 17 Report - 16.04.2024 - Julius Ortstadt

## Before today's session
I did multiple things before today's session:
- I continued working with ROS. 
I haven't made a lot of progress, I mostly read articles about how to do different things.

- I made 3D versions of some parts for the robot. 
This allows me to create a complete 3D model of the robot before completely assembling it.\

- I continued the overall 3D design of the robot so that I could print and cut the new pieces during the session.
This included adding all the other components to the 3D model.\

- I made some new charts and docs for the project. This allows us to keep everything organized and so we know what still needs to be done etc.


## During today's session
- After talking about the battery, we decided to get a new power supply first and the battery when everything works properly. 

- We received our screw order.
This will allow us to proceed with a clean assembly of the robot.

- I printed the revised versions of some components.
I can now proceed with the installation of some of them because the print failed at some point, leaving some components unfinished. 
I will need to print those again.\

- I finished the 3D model of the bottom plate of the robot where most of the components will be fixed to.\

- I cut the wood panels for the bottom of the frame as well as for the sides and the front.
I need more time to finish the back panel. 
I will therefore cut the back and the top one later.

- I put inserts into the front of the frame.
This will allow us to remove the front panel by just removing the screws whereas the side panels are hold in place with screws and nuts which makes disassembly much more complicated.
We did this to allow access to the robot.

- I started the assembly of the new frame.
We can already see that it will be much more robust when compared to the old one.\

## For the next session
For the next session I will:
- Continue the model of the robot.

- Add the remaining components to the 3D robot.

- Continue my work with ROS.
