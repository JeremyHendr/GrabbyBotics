# Session 6 Report - 16.01.2024 - Julius Ortstadt

## Before today's session
- After I realized last time that using the 5 IR sensor array wouldn't work properly in this project, I decided to use 5 seperate sensors on which I can change the detection distance via a potentiometer. In order to hold all these sensors, I created a new holding mecanism. This mecanism allows the sensors to be moved on the rail to set the desired distance. Additionally, the sensors will be hold in place via screws and nuts, which are inserted into the rail.\

- I assembled most of the different pieces of the robot in fusion 360 to present it during the mid-term presentation of the robot.\

## During today's session
- We presented what we did so far on the robot and what is to come.
- I printed the IR sensor rail system and tested mounting the sensors. After some small adjustments, the definitive version will be printed and installed.\

- I started printing a test piece of the frame to see if everything will assemble correctly. If that is the case, I will print the rest of the frame and assembled it.
- We ordered some new components for the final assembly. These components being the LiDAR, inserts for different screw types, right angle connectors for arduino, a fuse holder and two fuses.

## For the next session
- I will do a fit test of the frame and if everything is ok, prepare the necessary files to print the entire thing.
- Print the definitive version of the IR sensor rail.
- Continue coding the line following and start integrating the Ultrasonic sensors.
- Prepare the side pieces of the robot, so that next time I can cut them out using the laser cutter.
- Design the elevated support for the Arduino Mega so that it fits over the H-Bridge of the motor, freeing up the space for the Nvidia Jetson.
- Cut out the discs for the IR sensors so that the screw doesn't come into contact with the PCB.
